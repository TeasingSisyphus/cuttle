This is (the beginnings of) a 2 player card game playable over the internet. It uses node.js to run the server and requires socket.io and express to use.

If you have node installed, you can use the commands 'npm install --save express' and 'npm install --save socket.io' to locally install the dependencies if you do not have them in the directory with the server and client. They should already be found in the node_modules directory if you download the repo in full.

The game is called cuttle and the rules can be found here: http://www.pagat.com/combat/cuttle.html

It's fucking awesome and you should try it. I've made some tweaks to the game that will be reflected in this program, but for now the skeleton is so bare those details can't be noticed. 

Eventually, I will use this platform to create a generic card table that can be used by any number of players to play just about any card game.
